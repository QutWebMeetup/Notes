          <h2>Meetup Notes - 30.04.13</h2>
          <hr />

          <p><strong>Date:</strong> 30/04/13</p>

          <p>This was our first Meetup for 2013. Not a big turn out but a good meetup none the less. I left the meetup feeling excited for the next one desipite how tired and hungry I was. Thankyou to those who came.</p>

          <h3>We Talked About</h3>

          <hr />

          <p>This was a general meet and great session so we talked about a bunch of things in no particular order. Everyone introduced themselves and then we spent some time going through questions people had, ideas for future meetups etc.</p>

          <p>Some of the questions included:</p>

          <h4>What are the Core Technologies you need to know when getting started?</h4>

          <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These are the things we all agreed you must know inside out. HTML, CSS and JavaScript will form the basis of everything you do as a Web Developer and everything we do in future Meetups. The plan is to get everyone up to speed with these core technologies as quickly as possible so we can move onto some more advanced topics.</p>

          <h4>What is the difference between a Web Designer, Front-End Developer and Developer.</h4>

          <p>Laura, Thomas and I all had a crack at describing the differences between the roles as we have experienced them. I think the gist was that it depends.</p> 

          <p>When talking about Web Designers we said that there are often two types. Those who can code and those who can't. Our consensus was that if you are designing for the Web then you should know how to code. The web is not a fixed medium, it is dynamic and ever changing. How can you effectively design a responsive site in Photoshop?</p>

          <p>Front-End Developers work primarily with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and deal with the visual and interactive side of the site or application. Depending on the person they might do more "design" or more "code". I consider myself a Front-End Developer but I also have experience with the Command-line, managing Servers, Databases etc and programing languages like PHP, Ruby etc.</p>

          <p>Traditionally developers will be focused on more server side code like PHP or Ruby and they will work with frameworks like <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter">CodeIgniter</a> or <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. Still most developers will have learned the basic front-end skills, it's just they have chosen to specialise in something else.</p>

          <p>You will find individuals and agencies use these role descriptions very interchangeable so it can be hard to understand when just starting out. There are some great questions on <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> about these things.</p>

          <p>We also discussed:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Designing in the Browser v Photoshop</li>
            <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
            <li>Version Control, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></li>
            <li>Any others?</li>
          </ul>
