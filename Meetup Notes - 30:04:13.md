## We Talked About

### Questions

#### What are the Core Technologies you need to know?

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

These are the things we all agreed you must know inside out. HTML, CSS and JavaScript will form the basis of everything you do as a Web Developer and everything we do in future Meetups. The plan is to get everyone up to speed with these core technologies as quickly as possible so we can move onto some more advanced topics.  

#### What is the difference between a Web Designer, Front-End Developer and Developer.

- Laura, Thomas and I all had a crack at describing the differences between the roles. As a sub topic we also discused if Designers should be able to code etc. 
 
- We discused designing in the Browser v Photoshop
